Hello, I'm ChocolateMoo53. I've always been fascinated in technology and graphic/web design. In general, I have many interests. A big interest of mine is cloud gaming. Before any major services, I was building my own cloud gaming services on Google Cloud Platform, Azure and AWS. I am always learning new things about technology! Sometimes, I will write about what I learned on my blog. Not just about what I already mentioned but much more. I may cover topics on design, music, literature, movies or anything else that has been on my mind.
