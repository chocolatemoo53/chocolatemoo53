# About Me

Hello, I'm ChocolateMoo53 which is pronounced Chocolate Moose. I tend to focus on programming and graphic design but when I'm not doing that, I have a large gaming hobby and I take particular interest in cloud gaming. I also do love Raspberry PIs but I have yet to use for one for anything interesting or with some cool server software. If I did have one that wasn't used for anything else, I'd probably use it for setting up Home Assistant or using Navidrome to make a music server.
